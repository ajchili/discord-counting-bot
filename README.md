# discord-counting-bot

A silly little discord bot to learn how to build a discord bot.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

1. Install Node.js (v20 was used but you should have at least v18)

### Running

1. Create a `config.json` file in the `src` directory
    - You will need to specify the `TOKEN` and `CLIENT_ID` properties. You can obtain these from your [discord application portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
1. `npm run build`
1. `npm run start`
